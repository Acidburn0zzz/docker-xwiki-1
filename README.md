# XWiki [v9.5] Standalone â€“ Docker Image

**[The Advanced Open Source Enterprise Wiki](http://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome)**

[![Latestver](https://lv.binarybabel.org/catalog-api/xwiki/stable.svg?v=9.5)](https://github.com/binarybabel/docker-xwiki/releases)

This image is rebuilt automatically when new versions of XWiki are released, through the use of webhooks provided by the [Latestver](https://lv.binarybabel.org) dependency tracking tool, a [BinaryBabel OSS Project](https://github.com/binarybabel/latestver#readme).

**Pulling a specific tag of this image is recommended**, which will ensure you are not unexpectedly updated to a newer version of XWiki. Check the [Docker Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/binarybabel/xwiki/tags/) or [Github Releases](https://github.com/binarybabel/docker-xwiki/releases) for available versions.

## Recommended Audience

This image is aimed at small-scale deployments, perfect for teams or private usage. It uses the **standalone** edition of XWiki and an embedded HSQLDB database saved to the connected data volume. [See the XWiki documentation for other deployment options.](http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/AdminGuide/Installation)
